FRIDGE A food management system that can be utilised in residential, commercial and catering environments. The cross-platform application will allow users to input food they have purchased and the application will manage this inventory in a range of different ways. The goal is to increase awareness on the availability of food and when it needs to be consumed before so that users will waste less food. To encourage users to generate less waste, the application will implement a data analytics feature that compares the amount of food wasted by an individual and compares it to other users within the application, this metric is based on unused food that has passed its expiry date. Overall, the application could have positive outcomes on society and raise awareness on the issue of food wastage. 

## Technology overview
Core Technology: 
* React Native.
* Google Cloud: Firebase DB.
* Figma: User Interface Design.

## Branching Model
All development should be done on the "develop branch" the develop branch should always contain a quality working product. "Master" branch should be reserved for final releases. 
  
## Other Ideas
We believe that this is a new technical endeavour for the home appliance industry to consider. In a fully implemented version, we envision a computer screen embedded into the fridge that manages the input of items placed into the fridge, but management, reminders and analytics take place on the variety of devices owned by consumers.
